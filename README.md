# GraphLibrary

A Graph Library Implementing Multiple Algorithms and Graph Capabalities

## Introduction	

This library contains Algorithms such as: 

Prims MST Algorithm 
Kruskals MST Algorithm 
Depth First Search
Breadth First Search 
Dijkstras Algorithm 

Along with this - You can Add Vertices and Edges between the Vertices in an Adjacency List Format. 
TypeScript was used for this project to keep functions and algorithms in the graph strongly typed, preventing any mistakes with inputs.

## Description

To test the program, you will need to have Jest installed, which is a testing library commonly used for Web development (React, Next.JS)
Rather than using the graph library in a regular .js file. I wrote the tests in Jest as this is a more common, professional way to test functionality, and it also comes with a lot of great utilities that make writing tests easy.

10 Tests can be ran on the graph library, and the .test.ts file can be edited further for the sake of testing. 
These tests show the functionality of the MST functions, as well as BFS and DFS, Dijkstra as well.

## Requirements	
1. Desktop, or Laptop Device
2. Node Version 16.0.0 or Later 
3. Terminal / Visual Studio Code Editor Terminal
   
## User Manual
To Run the project, download the source folder from the repository, and place it in any given directory of your choosing. Navigate to the directory where the source folder is, and cd into the source code folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
1. Double check that you have TypeScript, ts-node, and Jest downloaded. (To run the .test file you will need Jest downloaded globally, so use the -g accordingly which can be seen below.
2. npm install -g typescript
3. npm install -g ts-node
4. npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest
5. npm i -g jest
